ALL I2C CHILDRENS NEED TO BE POWERED OFF BEFORE I2C CONNECTION.
THE PARENT MUST BE POWERED FIRST OR AWAKE FIRST BEFORE HOOKING UP THE CHILDREN.
IT IS OK THAT THE PARENT AND CHILDREN ARE POWERED ON AT THE SAME TIME.
THE CHILDREN MUST NOT BE POWERED BEFORE THE PARENT. IF SO, THE CHILDREN POWER CONNECTION WILL NEED TO BE RESETTED
SIMPLY RUN PYTHON3 I2CLeader.py on command prompt to parse I2C DATA
