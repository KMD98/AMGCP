# Information
  - This folder contain the code that provide the sensor fusion algorithm for GPS and IMU data.
  - It also contains the calibration code for initial startup of the robot.
  - Because GPS only updates at 1hz to have stable fix. It is better to fuse gps with a high grade IMU to get absolute updates more often. Ideal would be to achieve 10Hz with sensor fusion.
