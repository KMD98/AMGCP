deploy these configuration via u-center app on appropriate gps (3 gps in total)
Note that these files are 1Hz. Please change RATE setting to 100ms (10Hz)
Please disable REPOLNED message on RTK2Blite and POSLLH message on RTK2Blite on UART1.
Please enable NAV-PVT message on RTK2Blite UART1 and make sure RTCM messages are also enabled on UART1.
LEAVE RTK2BLITE UART2 ALONE BECAUSE THAT IS THE RTCM RECEIVER FROM BASE STATION
Note that RTK2B UART1 export only NAV-REPOSLNED
simpleRTK WEBSITE RECOMMENDS USING 10Hz CONFIG FILES BUT THEY HAVE NAV-PVT and NAV-REPOLSNED BOTH ON UART1 of RTK2B.
WE WANT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY GRAB NAV-PVT AND HEADING FROM REPOLSNED, THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TWO BLACK PILL TO DO PARALLEL PROCESSING
FROM EACH RTK2B (RELPOSNED heading) AAND RTK2BLITE(NAV PVT position and speed).
