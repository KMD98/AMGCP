the following codes work together to parse shp files and let operator choose waypoints based on drone flight. 
The program will ensure that the operator pick optimized waypoints that give the most overlap in drone imagery.
Files are in shp format so conver to .json before running algorithm MapChooseWP.py
Video Demo is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haW9aEzZedo
Order of execution is run python3 MapChooseWP.py
After picking WP in MapChooseWP.py, operator can run MappingJSON.py to see the resulting map. Must run MapChooseWP.py before MappingJSON.py so the local folder
can contain the xpath and ypath of the waypoints. IF operator want to see if the chosen waypoints fits with drone trajectory then run realtimeplotSHP
